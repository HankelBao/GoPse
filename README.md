# Pseudo

A pseudocode compiler for GCE AS/A2 Exam(not official).

Intented to be fully functioning, compatible with all codes on AS/A2 Syllabus, optimizable powered by LLVM. Serious enough for students' creative design.

## Why?

**Practice is the best way to learn!** Paper is not a teacher, but a compiler could be. Students no longer need to read and write code on papers. They could design their own program and test it.
